## ðŸ”· Why Webra?

Webra is a revolutionary smart contract language that eliminates all syntactical friction. No semicolons. No parentheses. No curly braces. No symbols. Just pure human-readable logic.

**Imagine writing smart contracts like you're giving human instructions. That's Webra.**

It simplifies smart contract development, auditing, and opens the door to non-developers.

## ðŸ§  The Problem Webra Solves

- Traditional smart contract languages introduce complexity with `;`, `{}`, `()`, etc.
- Most bugs come from syntax, not logic.
- Non-developers are excluded from interacting with blockchain logic.

âœ… Webra makes logic look like natural English.

## ðŸ”· Example Comparison

### Solidity (Traditional)

```
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
  require(balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
  balance -= amount;
  payable(to).transfer(amount);
}
```

### Webra (No Symbols)

```
contract MyWallet
balance is 1000
on transfer amount to user
  if amount greater balance
    reject insufficient balance
  subtract amount from balance
  send amount to user
```

> âœ… No symbols, quotes, or programming syntax. Just logic.
