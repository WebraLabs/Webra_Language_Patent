## 🔷 Why Webra?

Webra is a revolutionary smart contract language that removes all syntactical friction. No semicolons. No parentheses. No curly braces. No symbols. Just pure human-readable logic.

**Imagine writing smart contracts like you write instructions for a human. That's Webra.**

It reduces cognitive load, simplifies audits, and empowers both technical and non-technical users to engage with blockchain logic.

---

## 🧠 Problem Webra Solves

- **Traditional languages like Solidity introduce complexity** with symbols like `;`, `{}`, `()`, and logical syntax errors.
- **Most smart contract bugs come from syntax, not logic.**
- **Non-developers are completely excluded** from understanding or contributing to blockchain logic.

✅ Webra solves this by making contract logic **look like English**.

## 🔷 Example Comparison

### Solidity (Traditional)

```
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
  require(balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
  balance -= amount;
  payable(to).transfer(amount);
}
```

### Webra (No Symbols)

```
contract MyWallet
balance is 1000
on transfer amount to user
  if amount greater balance
    reject insufficient balance
  subtract amount from balance
  send amount to user
```

> ✅ No symbols, quotes, or programming operators. Just logic.
